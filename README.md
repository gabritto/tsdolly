# TSDolly
TSDolly is a tool for automatically generating TypeScript programs using [Alloy](https://alloytools.org/).
The generated programs can be used to test the implementation of refactorings.  
TSDolly is based on [JDolly](https://github.com/gustavoasoares/jdolly), which generates Java programs.

This work is part of a bachelor's thesis.


## TODO/Questions list
 - [ ] Should we always assume the existence of a `Program` object in a solution?
 - [ ] Which Java exceptions should we use when an invariant is broken?
 - [ ] Update README with more details.
 - [ ] Add instructions on how to compile/think about tool distribution.
 - [ ] Add instructions on how to run.
 - [ ] Add instructions on how to contribute.
 - [ ] Add license? (Must check libraries' licenses (guava, alloy, gson))
