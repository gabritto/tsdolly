# TSDolly
TSDolly is a tool for automatically generating TypeScript programs using [Alloy](https://alloytools.org/).
The generated programs can be used to test the implementation of refactorings.  
TSDolly is based on [JDolly](https://github.com/gustavoasoares/jdolly), which generates Java programs.

This work is part of a bachelor's thesis.
